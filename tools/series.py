"""The one table that says what each crossword series IS.

Every series fact the tools need — who publishes it, what to call it, what to do
when the feed ships no setter name — lives here and nowhere else. Import it;
don't re-declare it.

This file exists because the same knowledge had already been copied into four
places by the third series: fetch_puzzle.py knew the Guardian URLs, the SEO
builder knew the publisher, the pre-reset backfill knew which puzzles to do
first, and each of them had grown its own `== "quiptic"` branch. Adding the
Independent would have meant finding all four. Now adding a series is one entry
below plus, if it needs a new fetcher, one module.

The one deliberate exception is the badge tooltip in app.js: that is prose
written for a solver deciding what to attempt next, not a machine fact, and it
lives next to the code that renders it. An unlisted series there simply goes
unbadged.

# A puzzle's id is its series AND its number. The number alone is not unique:
# every paper numbers from its own 1, so the Guardian's 30,089 and the Times'
# 28,9xx sit in the same range the Guardian's own archive runs through, and the
# Guardian's Quiptic 1,395 will one day meet a backfilled cryptic 1,395. Until
# 2026-08-19 the id WAS the number, so puzzles/<n>.js was the whole namespace and
# the second paper to reach a number would have silently shared the first one's
# file — merging one paper's annotations into the other's grid.
#
# Numbers stay numbers everywhere they are DISPLAYED. This is the storage key.
#
# Series keys are one lowercase word, no hyphen — hence "indysunday" rather than
# "independent-sunday". The id is <series>-<number> and the LAST hyphen is the
# split, so a hyphenated key parses correctly but stops "^[a-z]+-\d+$" being
# true, and that shape is asserted on filenames and on progress keys in
# tools/smoke_test.js. One word keeps the id unambiguous to a reader as well as
# to rpartition. Use "badge" for anything a solver has to read.
